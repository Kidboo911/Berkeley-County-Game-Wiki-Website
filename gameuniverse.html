        The universe in witch all of the events take place is known as "Berkeley"
        and in said universe strainge events occour. 
        <br>
        People and objects can suddenly teleport into the universe or out of it into another randomly.

        This behavour is unique to Berkeley and Berkeley alone. 
        <br>
        The scientists in the Berkeley County Replubic still don't know why this happens.
